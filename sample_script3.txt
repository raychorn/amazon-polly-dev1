The first step is vital. Access a VR station and choose your destination.

After you load into the VR session you will look for the container you can drop your schematics into.

Get access from your organization leader who can setup the RDMS for you.

While in VR, you will retrieve the schematics then drop them into the container.

Exit VR.  You are done.
